/**
 * Describes the implementation of a session class.

 * The Session object provides read and (in level 2) write access to the

 * The Session object is returned by Repository::login(). It encapsulates both
 * the authorization settings of a particular user (as specified by the passed
 * Credentials) and a binding to the workspace specified by the workspaceName
 * passed on login.
 *
 * Each Session object is associated one-to-one with a Workspace object. The
 * Workspace object represents a "view" of an actual repository workspace
 * entity as seen through the authorization settings of its associated Session.

     * to the repository. If the incoming XML (in the form of SAX events)
     * does not appear to be a JCR system view XML document then it is interpreted
     * as a JCR document view XML document.
     * The incoming XML is deserialized into a subgraph of items immediately below
     * the node at parentAbsPath.
     *
     * This method simply returns the ContentHandler without altering the state of
     * the session; the actual deserialization to the session transient space is
     * done through the methods of the ContentHandler. Invalid XML data will
     * cause the ContentHandler to throw a SAXException.
     *
     * As SAX events are fed into the ContentHandler, the tree of new items is built
     * in the transient storage of the session. In order to dispatch the new
     * content, save must be called. See Workspace.getImportContentHandler() for
     * a workspace-write version of this method.
     *
     * The flag uuidBehavior governs how the identifiers of incoming nodes are
     * handled. There are four options:
     *
     * - ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT_UUID_CREATE_NEW: Incoming identifiers nodes are added
     *   in the same way that new node is added with Node.addNode. That is, they are either
     *   assigned newly created identifiers upon addition or upon save (depending on the
     *   implementation). In either case, identifier collisions will not occur.
     *
     * - ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REMOVE_EXISTING: If an incoming node has
     *   the same identifier as a node already existing in the workspace then the already
     *   existing node (and its subgraph) is removed from wherever it may be in the workspace
     *   before the incoming node is added. Note that this can result in nodes "disappearing"
     *   from locations in the workspace that are remote from the location to which the
     *   incoming subgraph is being written. Both the removal and the new addition will be
     *   persisted on save.
     *
     * -  ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REPLACE_EXISTING: If an incoming node has
     *   the same identifier as a node already existing in the workspace, then the
     *   already-existing node is replaced by the incoming node in the same position as the
     *   existing node. Note that this may result in the incoming subgraph being disaggregated
     *   and "spread around" to different locations in the workspace. In the most extreme
     *   case this behavior may result in no node at all being added as child of parentAbsPath.
     *   This will occur if the topmost element of the incoming XML has the same identifier as
     *   an existing node elsewhere in the workspace. The change will be persisted on save.
     *
     * - ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_THROW: If an incoming node has the same
     *   identifier as a node already existing in the workspace then a SAXException is thrown
     *   by the ContentHandler during deserialization.
     *
     * Unlike Workspace.getImportContentHandler, this method does not necessarily enforce
     * all node type constraints during deserialization. Those that would be immediately
     * enforced in a session-write method (Node.addNode, Node.setProperty etc.) of this
     * implementation cause the returned ContentHandler to throw an immediate SAXException
     * during deserialization. All other constraints are checked on save, just as they are
     * in normal write operations. However, which node type constraints are enforced depends
     * upon whether node type information in the imported data is respected, and this is an
     * implementation-specific issue.
     *
     * A SAXException will also be thrown by the returned ContentHandler during deserialization
     * if uuidBehavior is set to IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REMOVE_EXISTING and an incoming node has
     * the same identifier as the node at parentAbsPath or one of its ancestors.
     *
     * @param string $parentAbsPath the absolute path of a node under which (as child) the imported subgraph will be built.
     * @param integer $uuidBehavior a four-value flag that governs how incoming identifiers are handled.
