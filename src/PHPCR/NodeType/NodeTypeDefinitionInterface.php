 * has been registered. Note that the separate NodeDefinition interface only
 * plays a significant role in implementations that support node type
 * registration. In those cases it serves as the superclass of both NodeType
 * and NodeTypeTemplate. In implementations that do not support node type
 * registration, only objects implementing the subinterface NodeType will
