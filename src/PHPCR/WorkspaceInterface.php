     * Copies a Node including its children to a new location to the given workspace.

     * This method copies the subgraph rooted at, and including, the node at
     * $srcWorkspace (if given) and $srcAbsPath to the new location in this
     * Workspace at $destAbsPath.
     *
     * This is a workspace-write operation and therefore dispatches changes
     * immediately and does not require a save.
     *
     * When a node N is copied to a path location where no node currently
     * exists, a new node N' is created at that location.
     * The subgraph rooted at and including N' (call it S') is created and is
     * identical to the subgraph rooted at and including N (call it S) with the
     * following exceptions:
     * - Every node in S' is given a new and distinct identifier
     *   - or, if $srcWorkspace is given -
     *   Every referenceable node in S' is given a new and distinct identifier
     *   while every non-referenceable node in S' may be given a new and
     *   distinct identifier.
     * - The repository may automatically drop any mixin node type T present on
     *   any node M in S. Dropping a mixin node type in this context means that
     *   while M remains unchanged, its copy M' will lack the mixin T and any
     *   child nodes and properties defined by T that are present on M. For
     *   example, a node M that is mix:versionable may be copied such that the
     *   resulting node M' will be a copy of N except that M' will not be
     *   mix:versionable and will not have any of the properties defined by
     *   mix:versionable. In order for a mixin node type to be dropped it must
     *   be listed by name in the jcr:mixinTypes property of M. The resulting
     *   jcr:mixinTypes property of M' will reflect any change.
     * - If a node M in S is referenceable and its mix:referenceable mixin is
     *   not dropped on copy, then the resulting jcr:uuid property of M' will
     *   reflect the new identifier assigned to M'.
     * - Each REFERENCE or WEAKEREFERENCE property R in S is copied to its new
     *   location R' in S'. If R references a node M within S then the value of
     *   R' will be the identifier of M', the new copy of M, thus preserving the
     *   reference within the subgraph.
     *
     * When a node N is copied to a location where a node N' already exists, the
     * repository may either immediately throw an ItemExistsException or attempt
     * to update the node N' by selectively replacing part of its subgraph with
     * a copy of the relevant part of the subgraph of N. If the node types of N
     * and N' are compatible, the implementation supports update-on-copy for
     * these node types and no other errors occur, then the copy will succeed.
     * Otherwise an ItemExistsException is thrown.
     *
     * Which node types can be updated on copy and the details of any such
     * updates are implementation-dependent. For example, some implementations
     * may support update-on-copy for mix:versionable nodes. In such a case the
     * versioning-related properties of the target node would remain unchanged
     * (jcr:uuid, jcr:versionHistory, etc.) while the substantive content part
     * of the subgraph would be replaced with that of the source node.
     *
     * The $destAbsPath provided must not have an index on its final element. If
     * it does then a RepositoryException is thrown. Strictly speaking, the
     * $destAbsPath parameter is actually an absolute path to the parent node of
     * the new location, appended with the new name desired for the copied node.
     * It does not specify a position within the child node ordering. If ordering
     * is supported by the node type of the parent node of the new location, then
     * the new copy of the node is appended to the end of the child node list.

     *   the workspace before the incoming node is added. Note that this can result in
     *   nodes "disappearing" from locations in the workspace that are remote from the
     *   location to which the incoming subgraph is being written.
     * - ImportUUIDBehavior::IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REPLACE_EXISTING: If an incoming node
     *   has the same identifier as a node already existing in the workspace then the
     *   already existing node is replaced by the incoming node in the same position as

     *                                             However, which node type constraints are enforced depends upon

     * If the incoming XML does not appear to be a JCR system view XML document
     * then it is interpreted as a document view XML document.
     *
     * Changes are made directly at the workspace level, without going through

     * The flag $uuidBehavior governs how the identifiers of incoming (deserialized)
     * nodes are handled. There are four options:

     *   created identifiers upon addition to the workspace. As a result identifier
     *   collisions never occur.
     * - ImportUUIDBehavior::IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REMOVE_EXISTING: If an incoming node
     *   has the same identifier as a node already existing in the workspace then the
     *   already existing node (and its subgraph) is removed from wherever it may be
     *   in the workspace before the incoming node is added. Note that this can result
     *   in nodes "disappearing" from locations in the workspace that are remote from
     *   the location to which the incoming subgraph is being written. If an incoming
     *   node has the same identifier as the existing root node of this workspace then
     * - ImportUUIDBehavior::IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REPLACE_EXISTING: If an incoming node
     *   has the same identifier as a node already existing in the workspace then the
     *   already existing node is replaced by the incoming node in the same position as
     *   the existing node. Note that this may result in the incoming subgraph being
     *   disaggregated and "spread around" to different locations in the workspace. In
     *   the most extreme edge case this behavior may result in no node at all being
     *   added as child of parentAbsPath. This will occur if the topmost element of the
     *   incoming XML has the same identifier as an existing node elsewhere in the
     *   workspace.
     * - ImportUUIDBehavior::IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_THROW: If an incoming node has the
