/**
 * As there is no transaction standard in PHP this interface provides a
 * transaction interface similar to the
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Transaction_API">Java Transaction
 * API (JTA)</a>.
 *
 * You can acquire the transaction manager from a session supporting
 * transactions with \PHPCR\SessionInterface::getTransactionManager()
 *
 * A transaction is started with begin() and only permanently persisted if
 * commit() is called. If commit() is not called until timeout, the lifetime
 * of your php script or if rollback() is called explicitly, no changes are
 * persisted.
 *
 * Remember that session changes are never persisted before you call
 * $session->save(). Transactions are only necessary if you want to be able
 * to rollback over more than one save operation.
 *
 * The usage looks like
 * <pre>
 *
 *    $tm = $session->getTransactionManager();
 *    $tm->begin();
 *    // do stuff with the session
 *    $session->save();
 *    // do more stuff
 *    if (problem) {
 *        $tm->rollback();
 *    } else {
 *        $session->save();
 *        $tm->commit();
 *    }
 * </pre>
 *
 * A transaction manager might support nested transactions, meaning you can
 * call begin() repeatedly without commit() in between (but have to commit
 * every transaction you started).
 *
 * Remember that in the context of PHPCR, the rollback operation will only
 * reset the transaction but keep the current session changes. If you want to
 * get rid of them too, use \PHPCR\SessionInterface::refresh()
