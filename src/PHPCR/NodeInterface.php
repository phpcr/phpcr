     * Sets the property of this node called $name to the specified value.
     * This method works as factory method to create new properties and as a
     * shortcut for PropertyInterface::setValue
     *
     * If the property does not yet exist, it is created and its property type
     * determined by the node type of this node. If, based on the name and value

     * specific criteria. Once property with name P has been created, the
     * behavior of a subsequent setProperty(P,V) may differ across implementations.
     * Some repositories may allow P to be dynamically re-bound to a different
     * property definition (based for example, on the new value being of a
     * different type than the original value) while other repositories may not
     * allow such dynamic re-binding.

     * then the property type of the supplied variable is used and if the

     * type. Types are mapped directly, with the same exceptions as in
     * PropertyInterface::setValue:
     * * if the given $value is a Node object, it's Identifier is fetched and
     *   the type will be REFERENCE. To create a WEAKREFERENCE you have to
     *   explicitly specify the type
     * * if the given $value is a DateTime object, the type will be DATE.
     *
     * Passing a null as the second parameter removes the property. It is equivalent
     * to calling remove on the Property object itself. For example,
     * N.setProperty("P", null) would remove property called "P" of the
