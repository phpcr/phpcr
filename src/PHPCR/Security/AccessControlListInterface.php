/**
 * The AccessControlListInterface is an AccessControlPolicyInterface
 * representing a list of access control entries.
 *
 * It is mutable before being set to the AccessControlManagerInterface and
 * consequently defines methods to read and mutate the list i.e. to get, add or
 * remove individual AccessControlEntryInterface instances.
 *
 * The Traversable interface enables the implementation to be addressed with
 * <b>foreach</b>. AccessControlList has to implement either \RecursiveIterator
 * or \Iterator.
 * The iterator is equivalent to <b>getAccessControlEntries()</b> returning
 * AccessControlEntryInterface instances. The iterator keys have no significant
 * meaning.
