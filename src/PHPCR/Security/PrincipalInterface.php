 * As there are no ACL standard interfaces in PHP this interface provides the

 * The Principal is any entity that can be assigned privileges. E.g. a person,
 * a role, a computer.
 *
 * The reason to have this interface is that the PHPCR implementation needs to
 * store the principals and use them on later requests.
