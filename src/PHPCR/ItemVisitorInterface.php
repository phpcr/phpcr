 * Interface to define a visitor on an item.
 *
 * This interface defines two signatures of the visit method; one taking a
 * Node, the other a Property. When an object implementing this interface is
 * passed to Item->accept(ItemVisitor) the appropriate visit method is
 * automatically called, depending on whether the Item in question is a Node
 * or a Property. Different implementations of this interface can be written
 * for different purposes. It is, for example, possible for the visit(Node)
 * method to call accept on the children of the passed node and thus recurse
 * through the tree performing some operation on each Item.
