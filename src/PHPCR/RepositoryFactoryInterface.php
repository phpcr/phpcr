 *    $repo = \SomeRepository\RepositoryFactory::getRepository($parameters);

     * parameters.

     * Parameters are passed in an array of key/value pairs. The keys are not
     * specified by JCR and are implementation specific.
     * However, vendors should use keys that are namespace qualified in the
     * Java package style to distinguish their key names. For example
     * an address parameter might be com.vendor.address.
     *
     * The implementation must return null if it does not understand
     * the given parameters. The implementation may also return null if a default
     * repository instance is requested (indicated by null parameters) and this
     * factory is not able to identify a default repository. An implementation
     * should throw an RepositoryException if it is the right factory but has
     * trouble connecting to the repository.

     * @param array|null $parameters string key/value pairs as repository arguments or null if a client wishes
     *                               to connect to a default repository.
