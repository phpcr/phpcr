/**
 * A RepositoryManager represents a management view of the Session's Repository
 * instance.

 * This is useful for applications that embed a JCR repository and need a way
 * to manage the lifecycle of that Repository instance. Each RepositoryManager
 * object is associated one-to-one with a Session object and is defined by the
 * authorization settings of that session object.
 *
 * The RepositoryManager object can be acquired using a {@link Session} by
 * calling $session->getWorkspace()->getRepositoryManager()< on a session
 * object. Likewise, the repository being managed can be found for a given
 * RepositoryManager object by calling
 * $mgr->getWorkspace()->getSession()->getRepository().
