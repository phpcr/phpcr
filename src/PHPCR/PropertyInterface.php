/**
 * The property interface describes how an item property shall look like.
 *
 * A Property object represents the smallest granularity of content storage.
 * It has a single parent node and no children. A property consists of a name
 * and a value, or in the case of multi-value properties, a set of values all
 * of the same type.
 *
 * The \Traversable interface enables the implementation to be addressed with
 * <b>foreach</b>. Properties have to implement either \IteratorAggregate or
 * \Iterator.
 * The iterator is equivalent to <b>getNativeValue()</b> returning an iterator
 * of all values of this property (which is exactly one except for multivalue
 * properties). The iterator keys have no significant meaning.
 *
 * <b>PHPCR Note:</b>
 * We removed the Value interface and consequently the getValue() and
 * getValues() methods. If you just want the property value in its native type,
 * use getNativeValue, or just NodeInterface::getPropertyValue.
 * The PropertyInterface::getXX methods also work for multivalue properties.
 * They return arrays in case of multivalue.
 * PropertyInterface::setValue completely replaces the
 * ValueFactory::createValue method.
