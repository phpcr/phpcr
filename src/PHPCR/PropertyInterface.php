/**
 * The property interface describes how an item property shall look like.
 *
 * A Property object represents the smallest granularity of content storage.
 * It has a single parent node and no children. A property consists of a name
 * and a value, or in the case of multi-value properties, a set of values all
 * of the same type.
 *
 * The \Traversable interface enables the implementation to be addressed with
 * <b>foreach</b>. Properties have to implement either \IteratorAggregate or
 * \Iterator.
 * The iterator is equivalent to <b>getValue()</b> returning an iterator
 * of all values of this property (which is exactly one except for multi-valued
 * properties). The iterator keys have no significant meaning.
 *
 * <b>PHPCR Note:</b>
 * We removed the Value interface and consequently the getValue() and
 * getValues() methods. If you just want the property value in its native type,
 * use getValue, or just NodeInterface::getPropertyValue.
 * The PropertyInterface::getXX methods also work for multi-valued properties.
 * They return arrays in case of multi-valued.
 * PropertyInterface::setValue completely replaces the
 * ValueFactory::createValue method.

     * If the node type does not allow the requested type, a

     * If no explicit type is given, then the type is derived from the value.
     * (First value in case of multi-valuedproperty.)
     * If the node type allows the type of the parameter, this property changes

     * case and copy the binary data directly in the backend for optimal
     * performance.
     *
     * The type detection follows PropertyType::determineType. Thus, passing a
     * Node object without an explicit type (REFERENCE or WEAKREFERENCE) will
     * create a REFERENCE property. If the specified node is not referenceable,

     * call setValue with the return value of getPath called on the other
     * property and the PATH type constant. Passing the property itself and the
     * PATH type will convert the *value* of the property to a path.
     *
     * When assigning a stream resource to write a binary property, the client
     * application must leave the stream alone afterwards. The PHPCR
     * implementation is responsible for closing it after saving.
     *
     * This method is a session-write and therefore requires a <code>save</code>
