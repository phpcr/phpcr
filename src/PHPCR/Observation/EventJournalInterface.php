/**
 * An EventJournal is an extended Iterator that provides the additional
 * method skipTo(). All elements in this iterator are of type EventInterface.
 *
 * When interacting with the journal, you should first call skipTo or you risk
 * loading a large amount of events.
 *
 * <b>PHPCR Note:</b> This is the only iterator interface we kept, as it adds
 * additional value (performance). This journal is not countable on purpose.
 * There is a potentially high number of events in the system and counting them
 * could be very expensive.
 * seek() is an alias of skipTo()
 * rewind() should only rewind to the last point set in skipTo, not the
 * beginning of the whole journal.
