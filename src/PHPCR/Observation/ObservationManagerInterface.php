/**
 * The ObservationManager object.
 *
 * Acquired via WorkspaceInterface::getObservationManager(). Provides the event
 * journal and allows to register and unregister event listeners.
 *
 * <strong>Note</strong>: Event listeners will need some sort of polling
 * mechanism that is specific to your implementation. Consult your PHPCR
 * implementation documentation to learn how to use event listeners.
 * Alternatively, you can simply use getEventJournal to find events.
 *
 * The Traversable interface enables the implementation to be addressed with
 * <b>foreach</b>. ObservationManager has to implement either \IteratorAggregate
 * or \Iterator.
 * The iterator is equivalent to <b>getRegisteredEventListeners()</b> returning
 * a list of all registered event listeners. The iterator keys have no
 * significant meaning.
