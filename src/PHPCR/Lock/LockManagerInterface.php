     * explicit SessionInterface::logout()); if false, this lock does not
     * expire until it is explicitly unlocked, it times out, or it is
     * automatically unlocked due to a implementation-specific limitation.

     * use or ignore this parameter. If it uses the parameter it must set the
     * jcr:lockOwner property of the locked node to this value and return this
     * value on LockInterface::getLockOwner(). If it ignores this parameter the
     * jcr:lockOwner property (and the value returned by

     * is open-scoped the returned lock will include a lock token. The lock
     * token is also automatically added to the set of lock tokens held by the

     *      current session; if false it expires when explicitly or
     *      automatically unlocked for some other reason.
     * @param integer $timeoutHint Desired lock timeout in seconds (servers are
     *      free to ignore this value); specify PHP_INT_MAX for no timeout. If
     *      not specified, defaults to no timeout.
